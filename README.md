# Proof of concept

<p><b>Number X, Name </b>- <em>Description of the chosen factor</em> <p>

> Why?

- Describe the why's of this particular factor
- How does implementing it influence the development?
- What it means for developers?

> Test

If possible, write a simple bash script to prove the concept using a simple application. Show both the factor approach and the opposite of it. For example: storing config in-code vs in environment

```bash
grep ...
```

> Software and OS used in this implementation:
- OS: Which OS was used in this implementation (If docker, describe it)
- Backing service, Database: What backing services were used in this implementation?
    
> Comparison of twelve-factor way vs the opposite approach. Pros & cons:

|  | Twelve-factor      | Opposite |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Point 1      |Lorem ipsum dolores        | Lorem ipsum dolores |
| Point 2   | Lorem ipsum dolores        | Lorem ipsum dolores |
| Point 3 | Lorem ipsum dolores | Lorem ipsum dolores  |


```bash
Example result of your script showing twelve-factor example
```


```bash
Example result of your script showing the opposite
```
